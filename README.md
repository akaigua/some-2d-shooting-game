## 2D shooting game

**This is a 2d game with some Parkour and shooring elements. The protagonist is going to ran through an breathtaking advanture in  multiple scenes. Can he beat the game? It depends on you!**

- There are three maps of landforms in this game. These maps included the dangerous enermies. The only thing you should concern is to survive till the end.

- Every battle or parkour elements is in seperate rooms. There are several room types we designed, and they would be located in a maze. These rooms don't change from the begining, but the doors of it appears randomly. You could choose which side of room you want to enter. Also, if some time is still left before our time is finished, we might let you choose how may rooms are there in each game.

- There is a timer on the screen to show you the time he used to beat the game. As soon as you beat the game once, you couold find ways to beat the game in shorter time and challenge yourself again and again. We would also create a time leaderboard.

### Introduction to some basic elements in the game

- There are three kind of weapons you could use during the game. They would have different damage range, damage force, and attacking speed to the enermies. You could choose them in the start of each game and switch to another one whenever you want during the game. However, you could only hold and use one weapon at the same time.

- There are three status of enermies in the game, which is the non-alarm, yellow alarms, and red alarms.
There would be different numbers of them and different acting pattern. For example, in non-alarm status, enermies don't always face the player, they would sometimes trun around and walk to an opposite direction. However, as the alarm lever become higher, more enermies would notice and get closer to you.
