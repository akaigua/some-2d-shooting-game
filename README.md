### Introduction to some basic elements in the game

- There are three kind of weapons you could use during the game. They would have different damage range, damage force, and attacking speed to the enermies. You could choose them in the start of each game and switch to another one whenever you want during the game. However, you could only hold and use one weapon at the same time.

- There are two status of enermies in the game, which is the non-alarm and red alarms. There would be different numbers of them and different acting pattern. For example, in non-alarm status, enermies don't always face the player, they would go back and forth in their terrain. However, as the alarm lever become higher, more enermies would notice and get closer to you.
